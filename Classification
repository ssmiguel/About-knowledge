A classification of knowledge, using the synodic properties of the universe.

I.Cyclic, synodic, periodic, fundamental property of everything.
   A.	Evidence
    	1.	Celestial bodies
    	2.	Periodic elements
    	3.	Music, tones, harmony
    	4.	Electromagnetic waves
    	5.	Biological cycles
   B.	Adjustment of abstracts in concordance with concretes
      	1.	Synodic scheme of classification
	2.	Circumferential classification
	3.	Angular structure
II.Epistemology 
   A.	Types of knowledge
      1.	Acquaintance
      2.	Skill, ability to do
      3.	Prepositional 
      		a)	Words
        		(1)	Definition-description
	          		(a)	Positive semantic associates
	          		(b)	Negative semantic associates
	        	(2)	Constituents, functional units: grammemes
          			(a)	Definition-descriptions
            				i)	Positive semantic associates
            				ii)	Negative semantic associates 
          			(b)	Origin
	            			i)	Iterative
	              				(1)	Language
	              				(2)	Texts
   B.	Levels of knowledge: “synodic scheme”
    	1.	Binary, planar, bidimensional, cyclic, tetravalent, seasonal (winter, spring, summer, autumn) 
		a)	New moon phase, absent, unknown, and unnamed “knowledge unit” binary-0 [0,0] <0b00>, tetravalent-1, first stage, unexposed, 0º, 0%
       		b)	Crescent phase, beginner, novice,  newcomer, neophyte, binary-1 [1,0] <0b10>, tetravalent-2, second stage, student, apprentice, initiated, 90º, 33.3%, (1/3 of π), +1 z-index, 1 sd
	     	c)	Full moon phase, plenitude, full, master, learned, above average, tutor binary-2 {0,1} <0b01>, tetravalent-3, third stage, literate, competent, 180º, 66.6% (2/3 of π), +2 z-index, 2 sd
      		d)	Waning phase, eminent, expert, doctor, authority, binary-3 [1,1] <0b11>, tetravalent-4 fourth stage, matured, superior, outstanding, lofty, 270º, 99.9%,  (π),  +3 z-index, 3 sd
